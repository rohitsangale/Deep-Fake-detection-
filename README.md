## What-is-DeepFakes-
Deepfake is an AI-based technology used to produce or alter video content so that it presents something that didn't, in fact, occur. 
The term is named for a Reddit user known as deepfakes who, in December 2017, used deep learning technology to edit the faces of celebrities onto people in pornographic video clips.
